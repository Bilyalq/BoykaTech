I have been building and working with computers 
for about 2 years now and I just recently made my 
YouTube account about tech. On this account I will be 
uploading videos where I do all kinds of tech stuff. 
Computer building and even computer makeovers.

	<p> The first video on my channel where I built my brother a Gaming PC. </p></td>
	  
    <td>I have been on YouTube since 2012 but back then my channel was all about gaming.
	  This channel I have right now is only about tech and benchmarking the computers I build.
	  Most of my videos will be talking about some computer parts and what I personally think about those parts.
	  And the rest of the videos will be building computers for myself or my friends.
	  I like to buy used parts and build gaming/streaming computers. But I also like buying old used parts because I still find them interesting.</td>
