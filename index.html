Hello everyone! My name is Boyka and I am a YouTuber and Twitch streamer. I mostly stream on Twitch but I also make videos on YouTube sometimes.
I have been on Twitch since 2018 and on YouTube since 2015. The reason I quit YouTube is because the growth on YouTube is a lot harder than the one on Twitch.
The game I play and stream is VALORANT, it's a new game that hasn't came out yet and is on Open BETA which means only a few amount of people can play it.

    <td> Most of my streams are how me and my friends play VALORANT because this is our new favorite game. But I also stream games that we just have fun playing, but I stream those games only sometimes.
	  The main game I played and streamed before was Fortnite but since I was the only one playing it from my group of friend I stopped playing it so we can enjoy more games together.</td>
