Hello everyone! My name is Boyka and I am a YouTuber and Twitch streamer. I mostly stream on Twitch but I also make videos on YouTube sometimes.
I have been on Twitch since 2018 and on YouTube since 2015. The reason I quit YouTube is because the growth on YouTube is a lot harder than the one on Twitch.
The game I play and stream is VALORANT, it's a new game that hasn't came out yet and is on Open BETA which means only a few amount of people can play it.

    <td>I have been on YouTube since 2012 but back then my channel was all about gaming.
	  This channel I have right now is only about tech and benchmarking the computers I build.
	  Most of my videos will be talking about some computer parts and what I personally think about those parts.
	  And the rest of the videos will be building computers for myself or my friends.
	  I like to buy used parts and build gaming/streaming computers. But I also like buying old used parts because I still find them interesting.</td>
